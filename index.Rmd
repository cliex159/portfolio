# About me {.unnumbered}

I am an eager-to-learn college senior majoring in Applied Mathematics about delivering valuable data through analytical functions and data retrieval methods. At the workplace, considering myself a team-oriented critical thinker with intern experience and relevant undergraduate coursework, I am highly motivated to join a group of seasoned data analysts and cross-functional teammates where I anticipate growth and the chance to prove my abilities by reaching clients as fluent English speaker.

## Experience {.unnumbered}

Majoring in Applied Mathematics at International University, I have spent the past 2 years immersing myself in big data and machine learning from DataCamp courses. I came across this the online learning platform for the sake of passing the Statistics course with flying colors. My wish came true but DataCamp was much more than Statistics, It focused on building the best learning experience specifically for Data Science. Now that I am about to graduate, I accumulate all of the important courses learned so far into <a href="rpubs.com/cliex159">my Publication</a>. Learning from those courses, I assimilate all important tools available for data visualizing and data modeling in Python and R. Having a wide range of statistical and machine learning tools under my belt, I have summarized all of my projects into this website as my personal portfolio.

During the time, I had one year of experience as an IELTS Teaching Assistant at British Council in 2019 and 6-month experience at Intertu as an IB Math Teacher in 2020. I value the first period when I could spend my time with native speakers without feeling any uncomfortable as a Vietnamese. Also, I got used to the presentational pace of foreigners as how we could deliver a speech with the highest efficiency in 90 minutes. For the second period, It was actually a small private class where I personally tutored one or two students with an inferior performance at some international high schools such as District 2. I reclaim the time when I got to re-assimilate statistical tools in the mathematical theory approach. I wish these communication skills will do me wonder when I have to describe the visualization or the data modeling in both speaking and writing reports.

Currently, I am writing my Graduation Thesis and will have my Bachelor's Degree in June. The title of the Thesis is "Sale Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms" which you could find via <a href="https://rpubs.com/cliex159/894305">my latest upload</a>. The description of the publication has not been done but you could see how I can use the intertwining between Python and R to make visualization and modeling of the data. Other than that, I am also designing the web application for the course <a href="https://rpubs.com/cliex159/894305">Financial Risk Management 2</a> for my the teacher at my university.

With my background, I wish to work closely with the team members to collectively produce multiple teams' insights that can affect change for the sake of the company.
